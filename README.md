# ETL_PROJECT


In this project I decided to Export files from my Ferguson database (highjump wms) our main db we use for warehouse management system, I extracted to CSV file and imported in Jupyter notebook and #Transformed using the drop function to clean up the data and the columns I did not need.
I wanted to gather all information related to Productivity. I consolidated productivity per hour reports by warehouse associate and a end of the month report on productity percentage per associate on average. I then created a database in Postgres SQL to query through the large csv files. If I had more time I would've created a web to better visualize my best associates by productivity and the productivity transactions.
